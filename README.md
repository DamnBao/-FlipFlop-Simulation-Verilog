1.Introduction:
This repository is dedicated to designing and testing the functionality of different types of Flip-Flops using Verilog HDL.
The main goal of this project is to understand how Flip-Flops work and how to verify their functionality through simulation.

2.Contents:
a. Flip-Flop Design: Implement different Flip-Flop modules, including T Flip-Flop, D Flip-Flop, and JK Flip-Flop.
b. Testbench: Write Verilog testbenches to validate the output of each Flip-Flop.
c. RTL View: Utilize Quartus Prime RTL Viewer to visualize the synthesized logic circuit from Verilog code.
d. Simulation: Run simulations using ModelSim to verify the correctness of the Flip-Flop implementations.  

3.Simulation using ModelSim:
