1.Introduction:<br>	    		 	 	 							
This repository is dedicated to designing and testing the functionality of different types of Flip-Flops using Verilog HDL.<br>											              
The main goal of this project is to understand how Flip-Flops work and how to verify their functionality through simulation.<br><br>
2.Contents:<br>
a. Flip-Flop Design: Implement different Flip-Flop modules, including T Flip-Flop, D Flip-Flop, and JK Flip-Flop.<br>
b. Testbench: Write Verilog testbenches to validate the output of each Flip-Flop.<br>                 																			
c. RTL View: Utilize Quartus Prime RTL Viewer to visualize the synthesized logic circuit from Verilog code.<br> 												
d. Simulation: Run simulations using ModelSim to verify the correctness of the Flip-Flop implementations.
